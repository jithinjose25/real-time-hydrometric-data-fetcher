Hydrometric Data Retriever

A Python script that fetches real time discharge and water level data from USGS Water Services (United States) and ECCC Hydrometric Real-time API (Canada), 
computes daily averages, and writes the results into a pre existing Excel workbook (FLOW and LEVEL sheets).

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Key Features

•	Dual data sources – downloads instantaneous data for:
•	USGS stations (parameterCd 00060 = discharge, 00065 = waterlevel)
•	WSC / ECCC stations (Canadian hydrometric real-time collection)
•	Time zone handling – converts all timestamps to UTC before processing.
•	Daily aggregation – averages 15 min / hourly records into one value per day per station.
•	Excel integration – looks up the correct row/column in an existing workbook and overwrites the daily cells.

Prerequisites

• Python 3.9 or newer   – needed to run the script
• Microsoft Excel 2016 or newer – the target workbook (realtime_flows_levels.xlsx) must open correctly

Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt):
  - requests
  - pandas
  - openpyxl
  - numpy

Installation

# 1 – clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jithinjose25/hydrometric-data.git
cd hydrometric-data

# 2 – (Recommended) create & activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3 – install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Open the file “hydrometric_fetcher.py” and check these constants:

• workbook_path       – full path to the Excel workbook that contains the FLOW and LEVEL sheets (the script needs write access).

• USGS_station_list   – list of USGS station IDs the script will download.

• WSC_station_list    – list of Canadian WSC station IDs the script will download.

Tip: if you move or rename the workbook, update workbook_path so the script can still find it.

USAGE
-----

Run the script from a terminal:

    python hydrometric_fetcher.py

The script will ask for:

    Start date (YYYY-MM-DD):
    End   date (YYYY-MM-DD):

What happens next:

  1. Downloads every instantaneous record between those dates for all stations
     listed in USGS_station_list and WSC_station_list.
  2. Converts every timestamp to UTC.
  3. Replaces “no‑data” values (-999 and -999999) with NaN.
  4. Computes the daily average discharge and water level for each station.
  5. Writes those daily averages into the Excel workbook:
       • Sheet “FLOW”  – discharge values
       • Sheet “LEVEL” – water‑level values
     (Dates go in rows 4 and below; station IDs are in row 2.)

Extra:

  • A CSV file called test.csv containing the raw ECCC records is saved to your
    Downloads folder for troubleshooting.
